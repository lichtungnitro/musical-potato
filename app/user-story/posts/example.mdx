## What is a User Story?

A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective.

### Key Components

- **Role**: Who is the user?
- **Goal**: What does the user want to accomplish?
- **Benefit**: Why does the user want this?

## Example Format

> As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

```javascript
// Example code block
function createUserStory(role, goal, benefit) {
  return `As a ${role}, I want ${goal} so that ${benefit}.`;
}
```

## Conclusion

User stories help teams understand the value of features from the user's perspective.
